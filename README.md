# Exodus Website Enhancement Project

## Overview

Exodus, a Travelopia brand specializing in Adventure travel, is facing an issue with the conversion rate on its destination pages. The current design of the destination pages includes a lengthy description, and the web owner believes that shortening the description could improve the conversion rate. This project aims to address the issue by updating the description content on a sample destination page.

## Problem Statement

The current destination page for Armenia Tours (https://www.exodus.co.uk/destinations/europe-holidays/armenia-holidays) has a lengthy description, which may impact user engagement and conversion rates.

## Solution

To address the conversion rate issue, the description content for "Armenia Tours" will be shortened to make it more concise. This aims to ensure that users are more likely to notice the Call To Action (CTA) sections and, consequently, are more likely to book a tour.

## Implementation

The provided JavaScript and CSS files are designed to update the description section on the page. The changes will be applied dynamically to enhance the user experience.

### JavaScript

The JavaScript file (`updateDescription.js`) contains the code to modify the description content on the Armenia Tours page.

### CSS
